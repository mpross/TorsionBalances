# TorsionBalances
## By M.P.Ross

Although torsion balances were invented in the 18th century, updated version are still used in cutting edge physics research. As a student, I found a lack of introductory materials on the subjest so I decided to write my own. This is an introduction to torsion balance apparatus geared towards students in torsion balance research groups. All content is free to use and share.
